# wpdevmanager
By: Ale Vecchi, Austin Tindle

wpdevmanager is a command-line utility that helps developing multiple sites at UCF College of Arts and humanities much easier.

## How does it work?
Hopefully, this utility will be able to:

<ol>
  <li>Create, manage, and remove unique Wordpress installations for each theme that is being developed</li>
  <li>Allow for importing each site into a local installation of Wordpress to create a better staging environment</li>
  <li>Manage hosts file to create a simple and effiecient working environment</li>
</ol>

The idea is to have a functional staging environment for many Wordpress sites.

## Installation

To install wpdevmanager run the following commands:
<pre><code>git clone </code></pre>
