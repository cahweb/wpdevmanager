# wpdevmanager
By: Ale Vecchi, Austin Tindle

wpdevmanager is a command-line utility that helps developing multiple sites at UCF College of Arts and humanities much easier.

## How does it work?
Hopefully, this utility will be able to:

<ol>
  <li>Create, manage, and remove unique Wordpress installations for each theme that is being developed</li>
  <li>Allow for importing each site into a local installation of Wordpress to create a better staging environment</li>
  <li>Manage hosts file to create a simple and effiecient working environment</li>
</ol>

The idea is to have a functional staging environment for many Wordpress sites.

## Prerequisites
In order to use this utility your server and local environment have to be structured a certain way (hopefully in the future this won't be neccessary).
### Server
  <ul>
    <li>Apache</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
    <li>OpenSSH</li>
  </ul>

### Local

## Installation

To install wpdevmanager run the following commands:
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/cahweb/wpdevmanager.git wpdevmanager-master

cd wpdevmanager-master

./install.sh
</code></pre>

This will install all the binaries in the bin folder into your /usr/local/bin folder giving you access to them anywhere.
